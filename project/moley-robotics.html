        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <p>As students on MA User Experience Design at the University of the Arts London, we worked with Moley Robotics, the world’s first robotic kitchen, to explored social relations and physical interactions between a robot chef and its human guests.</p>
            <p>Integrating role-play, body-storming, prototyping, video analysis and speculative design, our group devised 16 robot behaviour modes and a systematic research method examining human-robot interactions. The project aspires to address the lack of attention given to the complexity of this subject, supporting Moley Robotics and other robot company to design and evaluate their product.</p>

        <h2>Body-storming: Personating the “Unapproachable” Robot</h2>
        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic challenges corporations and schools worldwide, placing accessing obstacles for both Moley Robotics and us. First, we have minimal visiting opportunities for the actual robot due to social distancing. On the other hand, the robot is at the pre-sale stage with multiple confidential technologies, resulting in a shortage of current customers research. <strong>How do we design for such an advanced cooking robot with limited visiting? And how do we tackle the complex, futuristic human-robot interaction in just seven weeks?</strong></p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../assets/moley/moley-robot.jpg" alt="moley cooking robot" class="m">

        </figure>
        <p>We kickstarted the project by documenting and studying our daily cooking routine to understand the existing social factors in the whole journey, from food preparation, cooking, dining to cleaning. Fruitful, instinctive correlations occurred between chefs, guests, food, and even machines (rice cooker, oven, hub). </p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p class="center">However, compared to the live demo by Moley Robot and other cooking robots on the market, we discerned a significant lack of layered intimacies, conversations, senses and emotions. During our body-storming research, we asked participants to personate the robot chef and human guests in different scenarios, and serval of them reflected:</p>
        
        <quote class="center">The kitchen feels no longer a social space...</quote>
        
        <p class="center">It almost feels that robots run the risk of programming social behaviours in this domestic setting, allowing the logic of a strictly defined set of movements and meanings to dominate.</p>
    </section>  
    <section>
        <h2>Iterating the Role-play Experience</h2>
        <p>Discovering that body-storming could be a valuable design method, we realised the necessity to improve the fidelity of all the kitchen settings, the “robot” partner, and props as much as possible to aid the more profound role-play experience. It drove us to build a 1:1 scale mini kitchen with robot hands extended from the wall! </p>
        <p>The kitchen settings alter the direction of the robotic arms facing the audience and hope to evoke a more friendly, intimated impression. Some scripts and rules were also implemented in different scenarios, scaling from using only one big button, customising cuisine on an iPad, to co-cooking with the robot chef.</p>

        <h2>Human-Robot Relations & Interactions Matrix</h2>
        <p>Previous rounds of role-playing made us realise the complex nature of human-robot interaction. So rather than looking at only one level of connection, an immense opportunity arose in investigating existing robots and automated systems and applying that to various robot cooking scenarios.</p>

        <p class="center">The research method aims to give designers a way of creating machines, interfaces and social interactions among devices and people. The matrix includes two inter-related axes: <strong>physical interactions</strong> and <strong>social relations</strong>. Each axis is divided into four levels: <strong>minimum, low, high, maximum</strong>. It resulted in 16 behavioural modes along a rising scale of connectedness between humans and robots.</p>

        <h2>Project Feedback</h2>
        <p>In the end, we deliver a booklet explaining the design method along with the 16 behaviour mode website. James Taylor, Development Chef at Moley Robotics, considered our project a novel study for the company and even the robot industry since it is not limited to one specific interaction but a scale of coordinating human and robot counterparts in fruitful scenarios.</p>

        <quote>I haven’t seen anyone in the industry is doing this at the moment. Some of the demos are great for the office to think about robot engagement in actual scenarios...and the booklet is amazing.  <br><name>– James Taylor, Development Chef at Moley Robotics</name></quote>

        <p class="center">This project echoes a mix of complexity, excitement and playfulness. Human-robot interaction is a sophisticated topic, and very often, people treat it with a technical-centred mindset. I learned a unique perspective on how designers could tackle this problem and other similar subjects by introducing humanity, creativity and collaboration into the rigorous research journey.</p>
        <p class="center">p.s. Special thanks to my team with Ana, Sanjana, Tiana and our tutors John and Al. I enjoyed working with them and learned so much about culture, food, language and design skills!</p>
