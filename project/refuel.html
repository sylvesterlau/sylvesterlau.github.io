        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The most popular media of fragmentation learning includes articles, videos, audiobooks, and podcasts.
                Audio content users get attractive by the surroundings regularly and then lose attention to the content.
                Articles and videos are not interactive and fail to get the users involved. Besides, we would take these
                as an educative moment instead of formal learning for its lack of systematic process.</p>

            <p>We aimed to develop better tools and content for fragmentation-learners:
                courses that are effective for short-time learning,
                a systematic learning process,
                and <strong>make it fun and easy!</strong></p>

        <h3>Understanding Micro-learning</h3>
        <p>We had a few interview with the users and tried to map out their current learning situation. After some
            research, our team found that this model fits our research results: most of the beginners will use micro
            learning more often, while some of the senior learners prefer macro learning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clear and organized content is preferred.</strong><br>Our users start their journey after
                    work and tired, complicated or profound materials are not engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>A picture is worth a thousand words. </strong><br>Well-written articles include images as an
                    explanation or inclusion. They are the most vital and share-worthy part.</li>
                <li><strong>Needs to get involved.</strong><br>Users mentioned that article needs to related to the
                    actual situation. Questions and quizzes were also considered useful materials.</li>

                <p><strong>üëçüèª Pros of Micro-Learning</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faster mobile learning: Bited size content suit the working style and attention span of our
                        users</li>
                    <li>Better understanding and retention: A short, simple micro learning unit can be completed and
                        retained more easily than a more complex one.</li>

                <p><strong>üëéüèª Cons of Micro-Learning</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not for complex subject: Some highly detailed or complex topic may not be practical to be
                        introduced in a small course.</li>
                    <li>Not a replacement of macro learning: Micro courses are great for an introduction to a topic
                        or for refreshing knowledge. But it still need a macro course to fully understanding the
                        complex subject.</li>

        <h3>Aligin the Design with Micro-learning</h3>
        <p>First we create a learning map according to GagneÃÅ‚Äôs Nine Events of Instruction, and wireframe the
            overall structure of the course with content strategy of each step. The learning process is divided into
            three parts: Introducing, Learning, and After Class.</p>

                <p>Inspired by the popular flash card used to learn new words, I came up with the idea of using the
                    mental model in showing quiz and answers. The question is written on one side, and after tapping
                    the button, the answer would showed on the other side.</p>

                    instant-messaging apps these days, so why not just create an interface to recall the scenario?

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>Being part of the Refuel team is a unique experience for me. I praticed product design skills, and also
                have a great journey exploring how to learn.</p>
            <p><strong>Concepts can be better delivered by visualizing.</strong><br>
                I faced the challenge of visualizing many types of content is this course. It turned out that not
                every topic can be transformed into a micro-course, but simply drawing shapes and laying out
                mindmaps can help people understand the concepts way faster. Thinking out loud is powerful.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning how to learn. </strong><br>
                I was introduced to the concept of micro and marco learning during this project. It change my mind
                of understanding the learning behaviour later. Just like any other skills, understanding how it
                works makes you improve faster.</p>
