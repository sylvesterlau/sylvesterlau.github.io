        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Collaborating with the V&A Museum, our group in the MA User Experience Design course at the University of the Arts London aimed to devise a sensory, embodied experience of the V&A’s fascinating online collection. The project appropriates the Maritime Silk Road as a context, integrating VR, gaming and online exhibition, and aspires to address Asian cultures while challenging the traditional museum visiting paradigm.  </p>
            <p>As a result, our team have designed an immersive, interactive and generative experience, “Silk Road: Asia”, enhancing educational and research functions of the V&A Museum. We value the project can extend to other museums, exhibitions and galleries.</p>

        <h2>“The William Morris Problem”</h2>
        <p>This whole project was at a COVID-19 national lockdown period when all education and museums were exclusively online. Challenges originated in the missing spatial and tactile access of the collections and the hall, which we observed in <strong>directed storytelling</strong> as essential experiential elements to provide a unique visit.</p>
        <p><a href="http://jackcraig.com" target="_blank">Jack Craig</a>, the digital design lead at V&A, proposed an intriguing problem referred to as <strong>“The William Morris Problem”</strong>, representing the mismatch of online visitor’s content flow and the intricate exhibit management systems. Suppose someone interested in William Morris will likely come across relevant objects, books, events, and merchandise scattered over numerous databases and webpages.</p>

        <h2>Reaching through the glass</h2>
        <p>Inspired by some of the captivating online exhibitions, our group started prototyping various interactions correlated to V&A’s items to intensify visitor’s engagement. These fun experiments revealed inquiries with a digital-native mindset: What makes a virtual object or exhibition different from a physical one? How can we treat this project beyond digital replicating? WWe carried Processing, Webcam body-detecting and parallel scrolling navigation to build a coherent journey tackling the “William Morris Probelm” in the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/samurai-japanese-arms-armour">Japanese Samurai collections. </a></p>

        <h2>Expanding the narrative to Maritime Silk Road</h2>
        <p>Continuous testing and feedback exposed us that interactive objects serve great educational purposes for the museum if effectively applied. Nevertheless, visitors require a consistent context to make connections between items. Since all our team members come from Asian backgrounds, the study proposed a chance to address <strong>cultural confidence</strong> and reimagined the related history:<strong>the Maritime Silk Road</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Investigating objects</h3>
        <p>Each object integrates corresponding technology, such as webcam body detection, spatial audio and AR, to help audiences understanding those physical heritages in a historical context. Throughout the visit, one can investigate the detail of an ancient painting with a flashlight, appreciate the structure of a Chinese vase by “putting” it in your room, learning the missing pieces via assembling clay pot fragments, or play Indian bayan drums with your accompany!</p>

        <p class="center">The outcome is a virtual space host on Mozilla Hubs, an open-sourced VR platform. Before the journey, players can select their role as a tourist, scholar or merchant, and even customise their characters. After reading the guidance of the background story and inductions, all participants are free to explore around the island and enter different buildings, where they will encounter fruitful objects from the V&A online collections.</p>

        <h2>A continuing journey</h2>
        <p>Carrying the selected objects, players can sail to the following country and exchange items and culture there. We imagined that the virtual Silk Road journey would last, with our six-week project evoking offset. The complete Silk Road network wouldn’t exist without the contribution of multi-players and culture exchange. Assisted by the massive splendid collections from the V&A Museum, the design could act as curation and community for displaying objects and communication.</p>

        <h2>Project Feedback</h2>
        <p>Both museum industry practitioners and the other 10 participants felt inspired by our project.  Jack from the V&A considered the play-test to provide opens up an intriguing imagination for the V&A. Daisy, as a product manager of a cross-museum visiting platform, also saw great opportunities to combine this virtual tour with pre-visit or post-visit education. Participants responded more immersive and engaged in the experience than a regular exhibition but pointed out that further improvements could proceed in visual design and scale.</p>

       <p>I recognise our concept attempts to challenge conventional museum settings by integrating a collaborative generative exhibition. We faced many technical and resource limitations in this short project, making it unpolished but still imaginative. </p>
       <p>p.s. Many thanks for the constant support from Jack and my teammates  Ines, Svaney and Sanya, who started this experimental voyage with me.</p>
