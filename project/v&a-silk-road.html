        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Working with the V&A Museum, our MA UX design group at the University of the Arts London aimed to design an embodied experience of their fascinating online collection. As a result, our team appropriates the Maritime Silk Road as a context and develop an interactive, generative VR experience, <strong>“Silk Road: Asia”</strong>.</p>
            <p>The project strives to address Asian cultures and enhance the educational and research capacities of the V&A Museum. We value the project to extend to other museums, exhibitions and galleries while challenging the traditional museum visiting paradigm.</p>

        <h2>“The William Morris Problem”</h2>
        <p>This project was entirely at a UK COVID-19 lockdown when education and museums were exclusively online. Challenges originated in the missing spatial and tactile access of the collections and the hall, which we observed in <strong>directed storytelling</strong> as essential experiential elements to provide a unique visit.</p>
        <p><a href="http://jackcraig.com" target="_blank">Jack Craig</a>, the digital design lead at V&A, proposed an intriguing query referred to as <stong>“The William Morris Problem”</stong>, representing the mismatch of online visitor’s content flow and the intricate exhibit management systems.</p>

        <h2>Reaching through the glass</h2>
        <p>Inspired by some captivating online exhibitions, our group sampled several interactions with V&A’s items to intensify visitor engagement. These fun experiments revealed a <strong>digital-native</strong> mindset inquiry: What <strong>differentiates</strong> a virtual object or exhibition from a physical one? How can we treat this project <strong>beyond digital replicating</strong>?  We carried <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>, webcam body-detecting and animation to build a coherent journey tackling the “William Morris Probelm” in the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/samurai-japanese-arms-armour">Japanese Samurai collections. </a></p>

        <h2>Expanding the narrative to Maritime Silk Road</h2>
        <p>Continuous testing and feedback exposed us that interactive objects serve great educational purposes if effectively applied. Nevertheless, visitors require a consistent context to make connections between items. Since all our team members come from an Asian background, there’s a chance to address <strong>cultural confidence</strong> and reimagined the related history:<strong>the Maritime Silk Road</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Silk Road: Asia</h2>
        <p>The outcome is a virtual space host on <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com">Mozilla Hubs</a>, an open-sourced VR platform.  Before the journey, players can select their role as tourists, scholars, or merchants and even customise their characters. All participants can explore the island with optional guidance and enter different buildings to encounter fruitful objects from the V&A online collections.</p>

        <h3>Investigating Objects</h3>
        <p>All objects integrate open-source 3D models with corresponding technology (<strong><a href="https://github.com/bensonruan/Motion-Detection-Virtual-Drums">motion detection</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/spoke-adding-scene-content.html#audio-zones">spatial audio</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/">Apple ARKit</a></strong>) to help audiences understanding physical heritages in a historical context. Throughout the visit, one can light up the detail of an ancient painting, “putting” a Chinese vase in your room to appreciate its structure, assembling clay pot fragments to learn archaeology, or play Indian bayan drums with your accompany!</p>

                <h3>A Continuing Journey</h3>
                <p>Players can sail to the following country and exchange items and culture there. We imagined that the virtual Silk Road journey would last, with our six-week project evoking offset. The complete Silk Road network wouldn’t exist without the contribution of multi-players and culture exchange. Assisted by the massive splendid collections from the V&A Museum, the design could act as curation and community for displaying objects and communication.</p>

        <h2>Project Feedback</h2>
        <p>We have more than 10 participants in our play-test. Many of them responded more immersive and engaged in the experience than a regular exhibition but suggested further improvements in visual design and scale. Museum industry practitioners considered this virtual tour to open up imagination for the V&A museum and probably to combine with other pre-visit or post-visit education. </p>

        <quote class="s">You moved from a mere imitation of a gallery and examined ‘what experience we’re not going to see in a physical museum’.<br><name>Jack Craig, Digital Design Lead at V&A</name></quote>
        <quote class="s">Impressive to see diverse technology in a student project. I feel inspired and could imagine it in the industry with further development.<br><name>Dasiy, startup co-founder in museum and exhibition industry</name></quote>
        <quote class="s">I feel like travelling to an ancient town. Those interactive objects are surprising and playful but could go deeper for educational purpose. <br><name>Huan Huan Tang, play-test visitor</name></quote>
        </div>
       <p>I appreciate our concept attempts to challenge conventional museum settings by integrating a collaborative generative experience. We faced many technical and resource limitations in this short project, making it unpolished but still inventive. </p>
       <p>p.s. Many thanks to Jack (V&A), John and Al (Tutors) and my teammates Ines, Svaney and Sanya, who started this experimental voyage with me.</p>
