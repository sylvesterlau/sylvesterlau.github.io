        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div>
            <p>This experimental project is an exploration to visualize the “filter bubble”, which occurs when websites
                use algorithms selectively presenting information based on our preferences.</p>
            <p>
                The term “filter bubble” has grown into a frequent topic these years. Nearly every products and
                service we used had embed personalized algorithm and therefore created an echo chamber for us. I
                build this to get us thinking about our relationship with the online media, and suggest some ways to
                deal with the “bubble trouble”.</p>

            <h3>Why Explaining “Filter Bubble”?</h3>
            <p>Eli Pariser, descripes that personalized algorithms create “a unique universe of information for each of us … which fundamentally alters the way we encounter ideas and information.” My first instinct was to design a product to solve it, but only to find some existing conceptual projects that require massive data processing. However, although those projects are amazingly inspiring, I found them rather incomprehensible for most people around me, especially without explaining what a filter bubble is.

            <h3>Insights and Goal</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Real products require real data.</strong> Designing a tool may not be a good practice.
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. We are not familiar </strong>with how the “filter bubble” is affecting us, even we have
                heard of it.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Explorable explanations: </strong>Nicky Case’s <a href="https://explorabl.es">“learning by
                    playing”</a> interactive games pattern
                seems suitable, considering I was trying to explain a complex theory and make it fun.

        <h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>
        <p>Browsing some other explorable explanations made me realized that instead of trying to cover everything, it
            should illustrate the shift of one straightforward model. And I explored just the right visual model through
            a paper-based prototype.</p>

        <h2>Building the simulation</h2>
        <p>To make the simulation demo, I learned <a href='https://d3js.org'>D3.js</a>, which is a JavaScript library
            for data visualization and provides force layout of a smooth bubble chart. The simulation was constructed
            from basics. It began with merely adding and removing dots (pieces of information), and ended with an
            automatic running bubble chart.</p>

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p>With a suitable prototype, the next step is to build the storyline and visual elements. I choose the
                combination of a dark background and vibrant colours to highlight different types of news and evoke
                the
                visual metaphor of “the universe of information”.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p><strong>1. First experimental project practice:</strong><br>
                There are considerable differences between an exploration and product design project. Transferring an
                idea into script and prototype is a big challenge.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The power of a simple concept:</strong><br>
                A robust, powerful and memorable idea keeps people’s attention, and it takes efforts experiment to
                figure out.
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Coding as a design skill:</strong><br>
                I learned a lot about coding to achieve my goal in this project. It gives me confidence and ambition
                to try data visualization and generative art next time.</p>
            <p><strong>4. It’s fun!</strong><br>Creating something original from the ground up is exciting. But the
                result is also very unpredictable and hard to control.</p>
