        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div>
            <p>“Quantified-self” means to track daily lives with proficient and available technology to develop
                self-knowledge, and improve productivity, health, and work-life balance. However, it is based on
                continuous time-logging that requires extreme perseverance.</p>
            <p>This project brings the idea of mapping out the entire daily routine by encapsulating data from
                other apps. It builds a hub for quantified-self and gives inspiring reviews for us automatically.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>I was first fascinated by the features of smartwatches. But all of them just don’t add up to
            formulate a whole purpose and makes smartwatches still alternative devices.</p>
        <p>Reconsidering the most used apps on my watch, I realized that exercise, to-do list, sleep monitor is all related to how I spend my time, in other words, my daily routine.</p>

            <h3>The Book: Strange Life</h3>
            <p>The Russian Scientist Alexander Lyubishchev had invented his time-counting system and practised for 56 years with paper and pencil. His biography tells us the benefits and methodology to get a clear perception of time-spending.</p>

        <quote>But are we getting the full potential of a smart device in telling time?</quote>

    <section>
        <h3>Research: Timeline experiment</h3>
        <p>I tried to apply Lyubishchev’s method and illustrated daily routines for my friends and me. It
            was
            refreshing
            to sit down with the interviewees and review their timeline.</p>

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>Timeline unveils user patterns.</strong> Users often overrate working hours and
                underestimate
                leisure
                time. Reviewing the graph exposed indiscoverable patterns like distractions on work.</p>
            <p><strong>Digital devices cover most of our time. </strong>Even some older user who
                doesn’t
                use computers
                could
                use
                the location data to recall events accurately.</p>
            <p><strong>Manually time-tracking is painful. </strong>The user would quickly feel
                frustrated
                once they forget
                to
                log.</p>
            <p><strong>Natural language is better than timestamps.</strong> Some software provided
                complex, unorganized
                data.
                But
                we prefer to describe an event in a semantics sentence.</p>

        <h3>Create Friendly Timeline with Mulitile Devices</h3>
        <p>I first conducted a competitive audit to lay out all kinds of data available in other time-tracking apps.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Prototype: Events, Behaviours and Activities</h3>
        <p> Previous research shows how people described their time-spending. I came up with the idea of
            defining a
            behaviour with a start, process and end with different activities. There are three layers in
            this
            system:
            Events, Behaviours, and Activities.</p>

        <h3>Providing Insights</h3>
        <p>Quantified-self is not completed without valuable review and feedback. I designed “highlights” to automatically present information on productivity, sleep, fitness, distractions, and memorable moments.</p>

                a
                visual routine of your highlights. This revives the mental model of how people recall their
                events

            <h3>Back to the watch</h3>
            <p>As for “how we read the time on a smartwatch”, I designed the watch face that shows current time
                and task. Timeline is also available to see previous events of the day.

            <h3>My Takeaways</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Design for online-offline balance.</strong> This project enables me to take a deep
                dive into how people
                interact with their devices. Meanwhile, the tech giants are announcing “screen time monitor”
                everywhere.
                I
                took my first exploration and practice on the design for unplugging. </p>
            <p><strong>2. A review is just as significant as planning.</strong> While we all take notes on
                tasks in advanced, we
                often
                forget about reflection. An inspection improves us and gives insights.</p>
