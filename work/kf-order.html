                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <h2>Digitalization for a Traditional Brand</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Kungfu is a Chinese fast-food restaurant founded over 25 years. Kungfu provides excellent quality
                    meals and services through the standardization of Chinese food production, which makes it the only
                    local company in the top five in the fast-food market.</p>

                <p>As the company continued to grow, Kungfu needed to keep up with the trend of digitalization in China
                    and
                    provide a better dining experience to gain more customers and a better reputation.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="side">
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to improve both customers' ordering experience and restaurant staff's productivity by
                providing a
                comprehensive digital system in the thoroughgoing retail routine, and lastly deliver higher business
                value
                for the brand.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <h2>Understanding the users</h2>
                <p>We started with gathering necessary information of the existent users to get a clear view of the
                    current user
                    journey.</p>

            <h2>Findings and Solution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The customers were <b>diverse in age</b>. The product needs to be simple and straightforward.</li>
                <li>Most pain points were within <b>the order engagement</b>.</li>
                <li><b>The menu</b> was confusing and obstructing the fast decision making of the users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our solution is Kungfu Order (WeChat Mini Program): A phone-ordering service for users to make order fast
                without waiting in the queue or any downloads.</p>

                <h2>Lean product approach</h2>
                <p>We applied the method of lean product and agile development in this project, which focus on building
                    minimun
                    variable products.</p>
                <p>As the lead designer, I needed to deliver the design with rapid prototyping and evaluate them with
                    usability testing. We quickly launched the first version to see whether the users would prefer
                    phone-ordering than the conventional way.</p>

                <h2>Experiment Result</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>20-50% users prefer online-order.</b> Users (especially those around the CBD and shopping
                        malls)
                        thought ordering foods on the phone is way more pleasing than waiting in the queue. Our team
                        considered this a solid proof of <b>problem-solution fit</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>Less POS needed.</b> Kungfu Order helped ease the heavy burden of operation in restaurants.
                        The
                        staffs combined the service into the retail process and achieved higher productivity.</li>

            <h2>Design Iteration</h2>
            <p>While the company popularized the services to more restaurants around the country, some new problems also
                exposed:</p>
            <p><b>Low conversion rate.</b><br> The completion rate from the menu to finish remained only 50%, which means
                that users were having
                trouble in choosing the food they need.</p>
            <p><b>Lack of user growth and retention.</b><br>While we had complete the main feature, we needed to
                improve
                the products' capability in growth hacking to increase the quantity and loyalty of our customers.
            </p>
            <p><b>Inconsistent visual language</b><br>The interface design looks a bit rough under agile
                development. A
                consistent design system would help improve the design qupty in design sprints.</p>

                <h3>User Behaviour analysis</h3>
                <h2>Field Research and Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>At this stage, we have access to overwhelming users data. Data analysis gave me a new perspective to
                    find
                    UX
                    problems. Also, our team would go to restaurants every month to get inspiration through interview
                    and
                    observation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Design System</h2>
            <p>I applied the method of the Atomic design system and rebuilt all the UI elements to formulate consistent interface and experience. Collaborating with engineers, we implemented every design tokens, components and templates to maintain a cohesive design during fast scaling.</p>

        <div class="two-text">
            <p><b>Data-Inspired design: </b>I learned how to measure user experience, and the combination of
                both
                data analysis and interview give me a whole picture of macro and micro user experience.</p>
            <p><b>Design system practice: </b>I tried to introduce a design system in the project, and it did
                not
                just improve the quality of the product, but also saved a bunch of time for both designers and
                developers.</p>
            <p><b>How design contributes business values: </b>At the very beginning, the company focused more on
                profits. Design was just an inessential part. I tried a lot to communicate the role of design in
                building a great product and brand. To do that, I have to answer to myself first.</p>
