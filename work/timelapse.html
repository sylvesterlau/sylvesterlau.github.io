            </div>
            <div>
                <p>“Quantified-self” means to track daily lives with proficient and available technology to develop
                    self-knowledge, and improve productivity, health, and work-life balance. However, it is based on
                    continuous time-logging that requires extreme perseverance.
                </p>

                <p>This project brings the idea of mapping out the entire daily routine by encapsulating data from other
                    apps. It builds a hub for quantified-self and gives inspiring reviews for us automatically.</p>

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>I was first fascinated by the features of smartwatches. But all of them just don’t add up to
                    formulate a whole purpose and makes smartwatches still alternative devices.
                </p>

                <p>Reconsidering the most used apps on my watch, I realized that exercise, to-do list, sleep monitor is
                    all
                    related to how I spend my time, in other words, my daily routine.</p>

                <h3>Time-logging Research</h3>
                <h2>The Book: Strange Life</h2>
                <p>The Russian Scientist Alexander Lyubishchev had invented his time-counting system and practised for
                    56 years with paper and pencil. His biography tells us the benefits and methodology to get a clear
                    perception of time-spending.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Timeline experiment</h2>
                <p>I tried to apply Lyubishchev’s method and illustrated daily routines for my friends and me. It was
                    refreshing
                    to sit down with the interviewees and review their timeline.</p>

            <div>
                <p><b>Timeline unveils user patterns.</b> Users often overrate working hours and underestimate leisure
                    time. Reviewing the graph exposed indiscoverable patterns like distractions on work.</p>
                <p><b>Digital devices cover most of our time. </b>Even some older user who doesn’t use computers could
                    use
                    the location data to recall events accurately.</p>
                <p><b>Manually time-tracking is painful. </b>The user would quickly feel frustrated once they forget to
                    log.</p>
                <p><b>Natural language is better than timestamps.</b> Some software provided complex, unorganized data.
                    But
                    we prefer to describe an event in a semantics sentence.</p>

                <h2>Events, Behaviours and Activities</h2>
                <p> Previous research shows how people described their time-spending. I came up with the idea of
                    defining a
                    behaviour with a start, process and end with different activities. There are three layers in this
                    system:
                    Events, Behaviours, and Activities.</p>

                took my first exploration and practice on the design for unplugging. </p>
            <p><b>A review is just as significant as planning.</b> While we all take notes on tasks in advanced, we
