            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <h2>Micro-learning by swiping cards</h2></div>
            <p>The usual senary of micro-learning is reading articles, watching videos, or taking an online course on
                the subway. These media are not initially made for educational, so they have limitations for getting the
                learners involved.<br><br>
                Refuel App is where you can study skills like time-management, design thinking, and communications. The
                courses are displayed in a card-based interactive short session. Our goal is to help users learn by just
                swiping cards and tapping quiz.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>We aimed to develop better tools and content for fragmentation-learners: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Courses that are effective for short-time learning</li>
                <li>A systematic learning process</li>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <h2>Current Problems of learning</h2>
                <p>We had a few interview with the users and tried to map out their current learning situation.</p>
                <p><b>Clear and organized content is preferred.</b> Our users start their journey after work and tired,
                    complicated
                    or profound materials are not engaging.</p>
                <p><b>A picture is worth a thousand words.</b> Well-written articles include images as an explanation or
                    inclusion.
                    They are the most vital and share-worthy part.</p>
                <p><b>Needs to get involved.</b> Users mentioned that article needs to related to the actual situation.
                    Questions
                    and quizzes were also considered useful materials.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <h2>Understanding Micro Learning</h2>
                <p>After some research, our team found that this model fits our research results: most of the beginners
                    will use micro learning more often, while some of the senior learners prefer macro learning.</p>
                <p>The reason why most of the content on the market are inefficient is that they are not organized in a
                    marco learning structure. The users always just have enough time to read a single chapter of it,
                    therefore it is hard to understanding and out of context.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../assets/refuel/micro-learning-apply.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>While the micro learning model thrilled us, we also understanding that it is not for everyone, and
                definetly not for every topic. Here are some benifits and disadvantages of it:</p>

                <h2>Pros of Micro-Learning</h2>
                <p>Faster mobile learning: Bited size content suit the working style and attention span of our users</p>
                <p>Better understanding and retention: A short, simple micro learning unit can be completed and retained
                    more easily than a more complex one.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Cons of Micro-Learning</h2>
                <p>Not for complex subject: Some highly detailed or complex topic may not be practical to be introduced
                    in a small course.</p>
                <p>Not a replacement of macro learning: Micro courses are great for an introduction to a topic or for
                    refreshing knowledge. But it still need a macro course to fully understanding the complex subject.

            <h2>Aligining the Design with Micro Learning</h2>
            <p>First we create a learning map according to Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction, and wireframe the
                overall structure of the course with content strategy of each step. The learning process is divided into
                three parts: Introducing, Learning, and After Class.</p>
            <p>Next, I started to build the wireframe of each step. After some previous research, we thought our product
                should focus on organization and structure. The wireframe should also help user build an overview of the
                content. Some icons and numeric steps also indicated the structure as well.</p>

                <h2>Flash card metaphor</h2>
                <p>Inspired by the popular flash card which is used to learn new words, I came up with the idea of using
                    the mental model in showing quiz and answers. The question is written on one side, and after tapping
                    the button, the answer would showed on the other side.</p>

                    With a friendly copywrite, it gains users’ attention between text heavy content.</p>

                    image uses zoom-in and zoom-out motion to indicated a more detailed view. It also allows users to

                <p>The infographic or illustration in recap part serves as a recall of the content. We hope that after
                    the 5 min micro-course, the learners can fully understanding the knowledge by just looking at this
                    image. It is also very likely that the learners would share or save it themselves.</p>
                <p>There's not much tutorial about how to make infographics for mobile device. So I have to learn the
                    way it was made for poster, and think about how it would looks like when it's responsive.</p>

            <p>Being part of the Refuel team is a unique experience for me. I praticed product design skills, and also
                have a great journey exploring how to learn.</p>

        <div class="two-text">
            <p><b>Concepts can be better delivered by visualizing.</b> I faced the challenge of visualizing many types
                of content is this course. It turned out that not every topic can be transformed into a micro-course,
                but simply drawing shapes and laying out mindmaps can help people understand the concepts way faster.
                Thinking out loud is powerful.</p>
            <p><b>Learning how to learn.</b> I was introduced to the concept of micro and marco learning during this project.
                It change my mind of understanding the learning behaviour later. Just like any other skills,
                understanding how it works makes you improve faster.</p>
