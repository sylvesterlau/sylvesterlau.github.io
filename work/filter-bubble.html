                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <h2>Visualizing the “Filter Bubble”</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>This experimental project tried to explore a way to visualize the “filter bubble”, which occurs when
                    websites
                    use algorithms to selectively give information to us according to our preferences. </p>
                <p>The term “filter bubble” has grown into a frequent topic these years.
                    After being aware of it, I found that nearly every products and service we used had embed
                    personalized
                    algorithm, and therefore created an echo chamber for us.</p>
                <p>I build this to get us thinking about our relationship with the online media, and suggest some ways
                    to
                    deal
                    with the “bubble trouble”.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="img-text right">
            <div class="small">

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>According to Eli Pariser, the inventor of this term, those algorithms create “a unique universe of
                    information for each of us … which fundamentally alters the way we encounter ideas and information.”
                </p>
                <p>First of all, I was thinking of designing a tool that helps solve this problem, maybe a news app that
                    shows articles with different views. But after a quick browse, I found some inspiring projects with
                    similar ideas:</p>

                <h3>Findings and Insights</h3>
                <h2>The first step to burst the filter bubble is to know that it exists.</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The projects below require extensive work in data processing which needs real users and data. Another
                    concept
                    design couldn’t solve the problem. </p>
                <p>But when I showed them to my friends, it always took them a while to understand the meaning. Most of
                    them
                    didn’t have a clear view of what a filter bubble is.</p>

                <p><b>Real products require real data.</b> Designing a tool may not be a good practice.</p>
                <p><b>We are not familiar</b> with how the “filter bubble” is affecting us, even we have heard of it.
                </p>
                <p><b>Explorable explanations:</b> Nicky Case’s “learning by playing” interactive games pattern seems
                    suitable,
                    considering I was trying to explain a complex theory and make it fun.</p>

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>So I decided to make an interactive website to visualize and explain how “filter bubble” works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It should give an introduction to this term, and show the way it formulates the content we read.
                </li>
                <li>And it needs to provide some takeaway suggestions on how to deal with the bubble.</li>
            </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <h2>Writing a script</h2>
                <p>Unlike a product design project, I started with a script from something familiar (like browsing news
                    on the phone) to the introduction and how it changes our perception.</p>
                <p>I conducted some test and interview, and this script is too complicated, and the transitions didn’t
                    feel consistent. The interviewees started to describe their storyline, which gave me new
                    inspirations.</p>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <h2>Finding a simple metaphor</h2>
                <p>Browsing some other explorable explanations made me realized that instead of trying to cover
                    everything, it
                    should illustrate the shift of one straightforward model. And I explored just the right visual model
                    through
                    paper-based prototype:</p>
                <p>The squares are different types of information. If the user picks one square, it would be moved into
                    the
                    “click history” area at the right-bottom corner. And new pieces of information would enter the
                    bubble to
                    make the total number of squares stays the same.</p>
                <p>The model was simple to understand and remember to the interviewees. And some more complicated rules
                    could be
                    implemented on top of it as “algorithms”. </p>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <h2>Building the simulation</h2>
                <p>I tried to learn D3.js to make the simulation demo. D3.js is a JavaScript library for data
                    visualization and provides force layout that I could use to make a smooth bubble chart.</p>
                <p>The simulation was constructed from basics. It began with merely adding and removing circles which
                    stand for
                    information, and ended with an automatic running bubble chart.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>During the process, I learned much from both the research, design & coding and works from other designer

                students.</p>

            <p><b>First experimental project practice:</b> There’s a considerable difference between exploration
                projects and product design. Transferring an idea into script and prototype is a big challenge.</p>
            <p><b>The power of a simple concept:</b> A robust, powerful and memorable idea keeps people’s
                attention, and it takes efforts to figure out. </p>
            <p><b>Coding as a design skill:</b> I learned a lot about coding to achieve my goal in this project. It
                gives me confidence and ambition to try data visualization and generative art next time.</p>
            <p><b>It’s fun:</b> Creating something original from the ground up is exciting. But the result is also
                very unpredictable and hard to control.</p>
