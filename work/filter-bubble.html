        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This experimental project is an exploration to visualize the “filter bubble”, which occurs when websites
                use algorithms selectively presenting information based on our preferences.</p>
            <p>
                The term “filter bubble” has grown into a frequent topic these years. Nearly every products and
                service we used had embed personalized algorithm and therefore created an echo chamber for us. I
                build this to get us thinking about our relationship with the online media, and suggest some ways to
                deal with the “bubble trouble”.</p>

            <h3>What is filter bubble?</h3>
            <p>According to Eli Pariser, the inventor of this term, those algorithms create “a unique universe of
                information for each of us … which fundamentally alters the way we encounter ideas and information.”

        <h3>Related Project</h3>
        <p>I was first thinking of designing a product to solve this problem, maybe a news app that shows articles with
            different views. But some projects with similar ideas already exists. These projects require real users and
            extensive work in data processing. Another concept design couldn’t solve the problem. But when I showed them
            to others, it always took them a while to understand. Most of them didn’t have a clear view of what a filter
            bubble.</p>

            <h3>Insights and Goal</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Real products require real data.</strong> Designing a tool may not be a good practice.
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. We are not familiar </strong>with how the “filter bubble” is affecting us, even we have
                heard of it.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Explorable explanations: </strong>Nicky Case’s “learning by playing” interactive games pattern
                seems suitable, considering I was trying to explain a complex theory and make it fun.
            </p>
            <p>So I decided to make an interactive website to visualize and explain how “filter bubble” works: It should
                give an introduction to this term, and show the way it formulates the content we read, and provide some
                takeaway suggestions on how to deal with it.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <h3>Start from a script</h3>
        <p>Unlike a product design project, I started with a script from something familiar (like browsing news on
            the phone) to the introduction and how it changes our perception.</p>
        <img src="../assets/fb/script.jpg" alt="" class="l">
        <p>I conducted some test and interview,to find out that the script is too complicated, and the transitions
            didn’t feel consistent. The interviewees started to describe their storyline and gave me new
            inspirations.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Finding a simple metaphor</h3>
        <p>Browsing some other explorable explanations made me realized that instead of trying to cover everything,
            it should illustrate the shift of one straightforward model. And I explored just the right visual model
            through paper-based prototype.</p>
        <div class="col-2">

            <img src="../assets/fb/paper-based-2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>The model was simple to understand and remember to the interviewees. And some more complicated rules
            could be implemented on top of it as “algorithms”.</p>

        <h2>Building the simulation</h2>
        <p>I tried to learn D3.js to make the simulation demo. D3.js is a JavaScript library for data visualization and
            provides force layout that I could use to make a smooth bubble chart. The simulation was constructed from
            basics. It began with merely adding and removing circles which stand for information, and ended with an
            automatic running bubble chart.</p>

            <p>With a suitable prototype, the next step is to build the storyline and visual elements. I choose the
                combination of a dark background and vibrant colours to highlight different types of news and evoke
                the
                visual metaphor of “the universe of information”.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p><strong>1. First experimental project practice:</strong><br>
                There’s a considerable difference between exploration projects and product design. Transferring an
                idea into script and prototype is a big challenge.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The power of a simple concept:</strong><br>
                A robust, powerful and memorable idea keeps people’s attention, and it takes efforts to figure out.
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Coding as a design skill:</strong><br>
                I learned a lot about coding to achieve my goal in this project. It gives me confidence and ambition
                to try data visualization and generative art next time.</p>
            <p><strong>4. It’s fun!</strong><br>Creating something original from the ground up is exciting. But the
                result is also very unpredictable and hard to control.</p>
